I've been in the world of technology since I was a child, I'm a robotics enthusiast and I like to dedicate myself 100% to projects that spark my creativity. I don't miss opportunities to improve as a person and professionally, and I believe in the productivity power of a healthy environment for any team I'm part of.

Visit my repositories and get to know my hard skills, here are some of them:

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,ts,tailwind,nextjs,vite,javascript,nodejs,sqlite,prisma,supabase,postgresql,mysql,express,mongodb)](https://skillicons.dev)

### Currently, my routine as a Developer consists of:

Creating personal projects and contributing to the community, improving my skills in Full Stack Web development, mainly using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) with famous libs such as: [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) | [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and others;

I also produce in Native Mobile Development (iOS/Android), which is my main stack today since I found myself in it after a long time building responsive designs: [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) | [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) | [Expo](https://expo.dev/) | [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) | [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) | [Zod](https://zod.dev/) | [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)...

In addition to REST APIs using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/), I also have knowledge of Relational and Non-Relational Databases for both areas, mainly: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) | [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).
