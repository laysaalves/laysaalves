### Currently, my routine as a Developer consists of:

- Create personal projects and contribute to the community, improving my skills in Mobile Development Android, which is my current stack, using frequently: [Java](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/downloads/) & **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)**...

- I chose Mobile Development because I have a lot of experience as a user, so I started my career building hybrid apps with **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** and was asked to do freelance work, mainly developing interfaces. I explore this area using: [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) |
 [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) | [Expo](https://expo.dev/)...

- In addition to REST APIs using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/), I also have knowledge of Relational and Non-Relational Databases, mainly: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) | [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).
