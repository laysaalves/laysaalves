I've been in the world of technology since I was a child, I'm a robotics enthusiast and I like to dedicate myself 100% to projects that spark my creativity. I don't miss opportunities to improve as a person and professionally, and I believe in the productivity power of a healthy environment for any team I'm part of.

In addition to REST APIs using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/), I also have knowledge of Relational and Non-Relational Databases, mainly: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) | [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) | [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).
